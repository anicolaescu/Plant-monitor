# Plant monitor  PROJ324 - Plant monitor

The aim of this project is to provide an intelligent alternative to take care of your plants. This project is a fully functional plant monitor keeping track of the temperature, humidity, pressure, soil moisture and light intensity. These measurements can provide an insight into the plants well-being that can be automatically watered with capabilities to add up to two submersible pumps. 
This project consists of a 4-layer custom PCB board which features an STM32L073 ultra low power microcontroller with a Dialog DA16200MOD wireless module providing connectivity to Azure IoT Central (using MQTT). All the sensors are high accuracy and feasible for low current consumption. These sensors are Bosch BME280 for ambient temperature, relative humidity and barometric pressure, Adafruit Soil Moisture sensor for capacitive moisture detection and Vishay VEML7700 for precise light intensity measurements.
Keywords: STM microcontroller, Dialog DA16200MOD Wi-Fi, KiCad 5, PCB Design, Mbed Studio.

The code is yet to be published, but the schematic is available as a pdf.
